# Hybrid-Merge-sort-and-Selection-sort-algorithms-
This project develops a hybrid sorting algorithm combining Selection Sort and Merge Sort to optimize performance across various input sizes. It dynamically switches between the two based on dataset size, leveraging Merge Sort's efficiency for large data and Selection Sort's simplicity for small data, aiming for balanced, improved performance.
