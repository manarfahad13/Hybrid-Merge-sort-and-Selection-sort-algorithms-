# Hybrid Merge sort and Selection sort algorithms 
This project develops a hybrid sorting algorithm combining Selection Sort and Merge Sort to optimize performance across various input sizes. It dynamically switches between the two based on dataset size, leveraging Merge Sort's efficiency for large data and Selection Sort's simplicity for small data, aiming for balanced, improved performance.


## Merge sort
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that excels in handling large datasets by recursively dividing 
them into smaller subproblems. The sorted subarrays are then merged to produce the final ordered array. 
Merge Sort is renowned for its stable time complexity of O(n log n), which ensures efficient sorting. 
This makes it an attractive choice for scenarios where predictability and reliability are paramount.

















## Selection sort
